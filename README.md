## Web app visualizing earthquakes from a live API feed using Leaflet

Web app deployed at https://earthquakes-past-7-days.herokuapp.com/

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

### Earthquakes in the Last 7 Days and Overlayed with Tectonic Plates

    Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. The USGS updates its earthquake data every 5 minutes. We will use the GeoJSON API provided by the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

    Illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

   * Includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * A legend that will provide context for your map data.
